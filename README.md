# Natalie Lorenze

Passionate about learning and building, I began my coding journey in the summer of 2019. 

Despite having experience in CSS and HTML as well as designing the look and feel of websites, I want to deepen my knowledge and learn how to build web apps prefessionally.

I have a pretty good knowledge of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript thus far, but have a ways to go. 

Currently I am a UX/UI student at an online bootcamp called Flatiron.
